good morning mr president and members of the jury before we begin i'd like to thank you for agreeing to judge our work, 
my name is rami Ferjani and it’s my honor to present you my end of studies project which consists of designing and developing 
 a web application for the management of fitness activities developed within th Mega-DEV company

In order to illustrate our work well, we have chosen to follow the following plan:
First of all, we will present the general context of the project
Then we will move on to the study of the existing and proposed solution
Thirdly, we will  discurss the specifications 
Afterwards, we will present the conception,
Followed by an overview of the realization of our project
And finally , we will finish by taking a look at the conclusion and perspectives

Starting with the General Context

Within the general context, we ill begin by a presentation of the host company,followed by the motivation and problematic

We passed the internship within the Mega-Dev agency which is based in Djerba Houmet-souk, among its services we mention  
web/mobile development as well as software Solutions and digital Marketing.

Working out from home is becoming more and more popular, as more people tend to choose it over going to the gym which can save money and time , 

But in the same time,it can be difficult to figure out what you need to do on your own as well as it’s easy to 
lose motivation and get discourged since the comfort of our home doesn’t provid the  same motivation the gym enviroment does,
such as seeing other people exercicing can give a boost in motivation

So the proposed solution was to create a web application that allows its users to workout from home that takes into account various 
conditins as well as connect users with each other in order for them to stay motivated.

Now we move on to the study of the existing and proposed solution

After an indepth research, we have found three web applications that respond to our problematic:
 Fitness Blender, Bodybuilding sixpacksixweek, after that  I will present our proposed solution

Fitness Blender is a fitness platform that offers full-length workout videos, workout programs, and diet and meal plans. 

Orginaly it was an online retailer of sport supplements,  but now  it has become a great resource for workout plans created by experts

6weeksixpack is a website that offers a fitness challenge, it gives daily instruction but it doesn’t specify workout for specific users, and it doesn’t connect users with each other

This is the table that contains the comparison of existing applications according to these criteria: Design, user experince, Full body and home workouts,  interaction between users etc..


Now our proposed solution is a web application that allowed users to :
  -receive workout program based on certain conditions
  -to connect with other users to stay motivated
  -to create workouts ith daily instructions
   -to manage users and workouts effectively

After finishing the general context,we will move on to specifications…

The specifications will be divided to three parts:
 -system actors
 -functional needs
  -geneal use case diagram

Our system will have two actos:
-the user and the administrator

The user will be able to:
Register
Authenticate
Consult workout
Chat with other uses
Create support group
And finaly manage goals and settings

The adminstator will be able to manage workouts and users

To better understand  the fonctional neds, we presen the general use case diagram

In the following, we present the conception

In this section , we will present the Class diagram and the authentication sequence diagram

Moving on ,this the class diagram of our application

And now we move on to the authenticaion sequence diagram

Moving on to the realisation ,in which will start by presenting the technologies followed by a demonstration of the accomplished work

Moving on to the demonstration

And now we finish our presentation with the conclusion and perspectives.

The planet fitness application will allow its users to receive a fitness program that : meets their goals takes into consideratino multiple factors like users age gender
And connect user with each other as well as allow the admin to easily manage the users and workouts


In case we decided to continue workon on this project, theres more that can be added such a mobile version, a home feed where theres more interaction between users, video chat functionalite, a forum for question and nutrition and diets guides

I would like to thank you all for your attention. And feel free to ask any questions
