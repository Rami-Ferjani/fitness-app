namin types:
When an application state has multiple slices,
 individual actions typically only change one slice at a time. 
Therefore, it is recommended that each action’s type follows the pattern 
'sliceName/actionDescriptor', 

to clarify which slice of state should be updated.

Selectors:
 for each React component, you need to define which data from the store 
that component needs access to. 
This can be done by creating selector functions
A selector function, or selector, is a pure function that selects data from the Redux store’s state.
 Each component in an application that needs access to the state will have one or more selectors 
that extract only the necessary data for that component.

useSelector() accomplishes two things:

It returns data from the Redux store using selectors
It subscribes a child component of <Provider /> to changes in the store. React, not Redux, 
will re-render the component if the data from the selector changes.
